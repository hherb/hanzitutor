// `TAURI_DEV_HOST` is set when Tauri is building for a device on the network: it
// replaces the dev URL's host with a LAN address, and the server has to be
// listening there or the app opens a blank window. Left unset — the desktop
// case — the server stays on localhost, which is all the webview needs.
// Declared rather than pulled in: the project has no @types/node, and this is
// the only Node global the config needs.
